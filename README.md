# Argo Blackbird S3

This is a fork of the Blackbird S3 App with support for:

- object metadata
- specifying AWS region
- small bug fixes

## Deployment

- clone this repo
- `cd Apps.AmazonS3`
- `../deploy.sh`

You must `cd` into the directory then run `../deploy.sh` from within it. It will generate a `blackbird_app_sp.zip` directory. Upload that to Blackbird.
